An introduction to Stata in 2 pages.[^questions] Commands[^commands] that you actually type[^interface] into Stata[^do-file-editor] are represented  in `monospace font`. x and y refer to variables in your data.  The treatment here is intended to be extremely brief, in order to create a kind of "cheat sheet" that can be presented in 2 pages.  More documentation on any command is available in the printed or PDF Stata manuals, or by typing `help command`.

[^commands]: The general idea of most Stata commands is `command variable(s), options`.  Often it is not necessary to use any options since the authors of Stata have done such a good job of thinking about the defaults. 

[^interface]: The Stata interface makes it extremely easy to do rapid interactive data analysis.  Hit **PAGE-UP** to recall the most recent command, which you can then quickly edit and resubmit.  

[^do-file-editor]: Use the **DO FILE EDITOR** to save Stata commands that you want to use again, and to create an *audit trail* of your work so that your workflow is *documented* and *replicable.*  `log using filename, replace` will save a log file of your results.  `log close` closes the log file.

# Get Acquainted With Your Data[^codebook]

[^codebook]: `codebook x y` will produce a nicely formatted codebook of selected variables, which is especially useful if you have added variable labels with the label variable command.  `codebook` is especially useful for seeing how numerical values are associated with value labels.  `codebook` by itself will list every variable in your data and generate a lot of [probably too much] output.

`lookfor` allows you to find variables that contain a specified keyword.  This is especially useful in large data sets with many variables.  Often abbreviated keywords are the most helpful.  e.g. to find a poverty variable, type `lookfor pov`.

With very large data sets, it may be helpful to use `keep x y z` to only keep the variables with which you are working.

`describe` tells you about the contents of a specific variable. E.g. `describe x y`. `describe, short` will tell you very basic things about your data, including the number of observations in the data set, and the size of your data file.

# Process Your Data[^missing-values]

[^missing-values]: Data with missing values, often represented as negative numbers (e.g. -99, -9, -8) need to be recoded so that the missing values are represented as a missing value character (".") that Stata knows to exclude from calculations.

`recode x (oldvalue = newvalue), generate(z)` will recode a variable into a new variable, often a good idea.

`recode _all (-99/-1 = .)` will recode all negative numbers from -99 to -1 to missing for all variables in your data.  `recode x (7/9 = .)` changes 7 through 9 to be missing for x.  Indeed, `recode` will change specific values in your data to anything you want, not just missing values.[^encode] 

[^encode]: `encode x, generate(x_NUMERIC)` is often useful to create a *numeric* version of *string* variables.

It is often convenient to `rename` your variables so that the variables have more intuitively understandable names e.g. `rename x depression`.

You can create new variables out of old variables using `generate newvar = expression` e.g. `generate newvar = oldvar1 + oldvar2`.[^alpha]

[^alpha]: `alpha oldvar1 oldvar2` will calculate Cronbach's alpha from this scale.

It is sometimes useful to `sort` your data.  `sort x` will sort your data by the values of x.

# Descriptive Statistics

`summarize` gives you basic descriptive statistics for a variable, such as the mean (average).  Especially useful for continuous variables.  E.g. `summarize x y` or `summarize x y, detail`.

`tabulate` gives you a frequency distribution for your variable.  Especially useful for categorical variables.  e.g. `tabulate x`.

# Bivariate Statistics[^anova]

Tabulating two categorical variables together gives you a cross-tabulation of those variables, e.g `tabulate x y, row col chi2`

`pwcorr x y, sig` gives you the pairwise correlation of two continuous variables.

[^anova]: `oneway continous_var categorical_var, tabulate` gives you a oneway ANOVA of a continuous variable over a categorical variable.

# Multivariate Statistics

`regress y x` regresses y on x.[^estat-summarize]  
`regress y x z` regresses y on x and z.[^other-regressions]
`regress y x i.z` regresses y on x and z, treating x as continuous and z as a set of categorical indicator variables.[^idot] 
`regress y c.x##i.z` regresses y on continuous x and categorical z, providing both main effects for x and z and the interaction of x and z.

[^other-regressions]: Other regression commands follow a very similar format:  `command y x z` but are beyond the purview of this 2 page guide.

[^estat-summarize]: After running many multivariate models `estat summarize` will give you simple descriptive statistics for the specific sample used in that particular analysis.

[^idot]: `i.x` is Stata's notation for treating independent variables as *categorical* or *indicator* variables.

# Graphing[^graph-options]

`histogram x` will give you a nice display of one variable.[^histogram-options] 

[^histogram-options]: `histogram x, percent` will scale the y-axis more intuitively in terms of percentages.  `histogram x, discrete` gives a nicer display for categorical variables. The `percent` and `discrete` options can be combined.  `histogram x, by(y)` may be useful for comparing the distributions of two variables over the categories of y.

`twoway scatter y x` gives you a scatterplot of your data.  `twoway lfit y x` will give you a linear fit graph.  The two syntaxes may be combined e.g. `twoway (scatter y x) (lfit y x)`.

`graph bar, over(x)` is useful for creating a bar graph of the counts of a categorical variable x. `graph bar y, over(x)` will create a bar graph of the means of y over categories of x.

[^graph-options]: For all graphs, options after a "," will be helpful in titling your graph  e.g. `twoway lfit y x, title("...") xtitle("...") ytitle("...")`

# `by:` and `bysort:`

In many cases you may want to look at the results of some calculation for x, or x and y over a third variable z.  In such cases the by: syntax will be especially useful.  For example to look at the correlation of x and y over different values of z.

`bysort z: pwcorr x y, sig`
