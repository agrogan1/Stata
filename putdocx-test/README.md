# Test Of `putdocx` Commands

This directory contains a test of Stata's new `putdocx` commands. While `putdocx` can be very helpful in automating your work, it is not always intuitive. See `help putdocx` in Stata for more examples and explanation. 

`putdocx` can be especially useful with a common issue in working with Stata: creating nicely formatted tables of regression results in Word.

The file of commands is [here](./putdocx-test.do).
