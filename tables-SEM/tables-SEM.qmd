# Introduction 

A quick demo of making tables with `sem` in Stata.

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| output: false

library(Statamarkdown)

```

# Get Data

Data from [Multilevel Thinking](https://agrogan1.github.io/posts/multilevel-thinking/)

```{stata, collectcode=TRUE}

use "simulated_multilevel_data.dta", clear

set linesize 96 // set linesize for Quarto

```


# Run `sem` Model

Outcome is a function of physical punishment, parental warmth and the intervention. Physical punishment is potentially an outcome of the intervention.

```{stata, collectcode=TRUE}

sem (outcome <- physical_punishment warmth intervention) ///
(physical_punishment <- intervention) // sem model

est store M1 // store estimates from this model

```


# Make Table With `etable`

As long as the variables have variable labels, `etable` (with a few options) will automatically make a nice regression table. 

```{stata, collectcode=TRUE}

etable, ///
estimates(M1) /// using these estimates 
showstars showstarsnote /// show significance stars & note
showeq // show equations

```
