* Stata is a powerful and intuitive data analysis program. 
* Learning how to graph in Stata is an important part of learning how to use Stata. 
Yet, the default graphs in Stata can sometimes be less than optimal. 
* This document is an introduction to (a) basic graphing ideas in Stata;
and (b) some simple ways to make your Stata graphs look more professional.

# What are Variables?

* By variables, I simply mean the columns of data that you have.
* For our purposes, you may think of variables as synonymous with questionnaire items, or columns of data.

# Variable Types

* *categorical variables* represent unordered categories like *neighborhood*, or *religious affiliation*, or *place of residence*.
* *continuous variables* represent a continuous scale like a *mental health scale*, or a *measure of life expectancy*.

# A Data Visualization Strategy

Once we have discerned the type of variable that have, there are two followup questions we may ask before deciding upon a chart strategy:

* Is our graph about **one thing at a time**?
     + How much of *x* is there? 
     + What is the distribution of *x*?
* Is our graph about **two things at a time**?
     + What is the relationship of *x* and *y*?
     + How are *x* and *y* associated?

# Data

We are going to use the famous "iris" data collected by Edgar Anderson in the early 20th Century.

```{s}
    use "iris.dta", clear

	summarize
```

> The `iris` data set has 5 variables.

# Species of Iris

> Iris species images courtesy [Wikipedia](https://www.wikipedia.org/).

# Petals and Sepals

# Basic Graphs

# Continuous Variable `histogram`

```{s}
    histogram Petal_Length
```

```{s/}	
    quietly graph export myhistogram.png, width(500) replace
```
	
![Histogram of Petal Width](myhistogram.png)
	
# Categorical Variable `graph bar`

```{s}
    graph bar, over(Species)
```

```{s/}
	quietly graph export mybargraph.png, width(500) replace
```

![Bar Graph of Species](mybargraph.png)

# Continuous by Continuous `twoway`

```{s}
    twoway scatter Petal_Length Petal_Width
```

```{s/}
	quietly graph export myscatter.png, width(500) replace
```
	
![Scatterplot](myscatter.png)

# Categorical by Categorical `graph bar`

```{s}
    recode Petal_Length ///
	(min/3.758 = 0 "below mean") ///
	(3.758/max = 1 "above mean"), ///
	generate(Petal_Group) // dichotomize Petal_Length
	
	graph bar, over(Species) over(Petal_Group)
```

```{s/}	
    quietly graph export mybargraph2.png, width(500) replace
```

# Continuous by Categorical `graph bar`

```{s}
    graph bar Petal_Length, over(Species)
```

```{s/}
    quietly graph export mybargraph3.png, width(500) replace
```

# Titles and Labels `, title(...) xtitle(...) ytitle(...)`

```{s}
    twoway scatter Petal_Length Petal_Width, scheme(s1rcolor) ///
	title("Petal Length by Petal Width") ///
	xtitle("Petal Width") ytitle("Petal Width") ///
	caption("Iris Data") 
```

```{s/}	
	quietly graph export graphtitleslabels.png, width(500) replace
```

# Better Graphing With Schemes `,scheme(...)`

The easiest method to make better Stata graphs is through the use of predefined Stata 
graphing schemes.

# Pre-Defined Schemes

Some schemes, e.g. `economist`, `sj` and `s1rcolor` are pre-installed with Stata.

# Economist Scheme

```{s}
    twoway scatter Petal_Length Petal_Width, scheme(economist)
```

```{s/}	
    quietly graph export econscatter.png, width(500) replace
```
	
![Scatterplot with Economist Scheme](econscatter.png)	

# *Stata Journal* Scheme

```{s}
    twoway scatter Petal_Length Petal_Width, scheme(sj)
```

```{s/}
    quietly graph export sjscatter.png, width(500) replace
```
	
![Scatterplot with *Stata Journal* Scheme](sjscatter.png)	

# `s1rcolor` Scheme

```{s}
    twoway scatter Petal_Length Petal_Width, scheme(s1rcolor)
```

```{s/}	
    quietly graph export s1rcolorscatter.png, width(500) replace
```
	
![Scatterplot with `s1rcolor` Scheme](s1rcolorscatter.png)	

# User Written Schemes

Two of the best user written schemes are `plottig` and `lean2`. 

Use the `findit` command e.g. `findit lean2` to find these schemes.

# `lean2` Scheme

```{s}
    twoway scatter Petal_Length Petal_Width, scheme(lean2)
```

```{s/}
    quietly graph export lean2scatter.png, width(500) replace
```
	
![Scatterplot with `lean2` Scheme](lean2scatter.png)

# Michigan graph scheme	

I have written a `michigan` graph scheme 
described [here](https://agrogan1.github.io/Stata/).

```{s}
    twoway (scatter Petal_Length Petal_Width) /// 
	(lfit Petal_Length Petal_Width), scheme(michigan)
```

```{s/}
    quietly graph export michiganscatter.png, width(500) replace
```
	
![Scatterplot with `michigan` Scheme](michiganscatter.png)	

# Schemes as a Base for Further Tweaking

Schemes can be used as a base that can then be further modified.

```{s}
    twoway (scatter Petal_Length Petal_Width, msymbol(0) mcolor(red)) ///
	(lfit Petal_Length Petal_Width), ///
	scheme(lean2) 
```

```{s/}
	quietly graph export lean2Ascatter.png, width(500) replace
```
	
![Modified Scatterplot with `lean2` Scheme as a Base](lean2Ascatter.png)	

# Even More Tweaks

Based upon an example at 
[https://blog.stata.com/2018/10/02/scheming-your-way-to-your-favorite-graph-style/](https://blog.stata.com/2018/10/02/scheming-your-way-to-your-favorite-graph-style/)

```{s}
    twoway scatter Sepal_Length Sepal_Width Petal_Width Petal_Length, /// 
	color(%50 %50 %50) /// transparency 
	title("Multiple Iris Characteristics") /// title
	scheme(s1rcolor) // scheme
```

```{s/}
	quietly graph export s1rcolorAscatter.png, width(500) replace
```
