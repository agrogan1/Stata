# A Very Short Introduction to Stata

The basic philosophy of Stata---“Stata in one sentence”---is `do_something to_a_variable, options`

The general idea of most Stata commands is `command variables, options`. Often it is not necessary to use any options since the authors of Stata have done such a good job of thinking about the defaults. Commands that you actually type are represented in `monospace` font. `x` and `y` refer to variables in your data.

| Task | Command | 
|------|-----|
| Descriptive statistics | `summarize x y` |
| Frequencies | `tabulate x` |
| Correlation | `corr x y` |
| Regression | `regress y x` |
| Histogram | | `histogram x` |
| Scatterplot | `twoway scatter y x` |
