The basic philosophy of Stata---“Stata in one sentence”---is: 

`do_something to_variable(s), options`

The general idea of most Stata commands is `command variable(s), options`. Often it is not necessary to use any options since the authors of Stata have done such a good job of thinking about the defaults. Commands that you actually type are represented in `monospace` font. `x` and `y` refer to variables in your data.

| Task                            | Command                       | 
|---------------------------------|-------------------------------|
| Open data                       | `use mydata.dta`              |
| Descriptive statistics          | `summarize x y`               |
| Frequencies                     | `tabulate x`                  |
| Correlation                     | `corr x y`                    |
| Regression                      | `regress y x z`               |
| Logistic Regression             | `logit y x z, or` [^logit]    |
| Ordinal Logistic Regression     | `ologit y x z, or` [^ologit]  |
| Multinomial Logistic Regression | `mlogit y x z, rr` [^mlogit]  |
| Multilevel Model                | `mixed y x z || group: x`     |
| Structural Equation Modeling    | `sem (y <- x m z) (m <- x z)` |
| Histogram                       | `histogram x` [^graph]        |
| Bar Graph                       | `graph bar, over(x)`          |
| Bar Graph (of means)            | `graph bar y, over(x)`        |
| Pie Chart                       | `graph pie, over(x)`          |
| Scatterplot                     | `twoway scatter y x`          |

[^logit]: Here we need to use the `, or` option to ask for *odds ratios* instead of *logit coefficients*.
[^ologit]: Here again we need to use the `, or` option to ask for *odds ratios* instead of *logit coefficients*.
[^mlogit]: Here we need to use the `, rr` option to ask for *risk ratios* instead of *logit coefficients*.
[^graph]: For graphing commands, you can often add options after a `,`. e.g. `title("title of the graph")`, `xtitle("title of the x axis")`, `ytitle("title of the y axis")`.
